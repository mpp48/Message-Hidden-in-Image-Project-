# Message-Hidden-in-Image-Project-
A program that can encode a string into an image as a series of bits. Depending on the bit, the pixel color is changed. The string can also then be decoded and retranslated. While the main goal of the project is completed, there is still far more that will be added in future updates.


#How to Use the Program
1) Install OpenCV for C++ to a IDE like Visual Studio.
2) Open the source code for the program and change the "C:\\Users\\Mark\\Pictures\\blue.png" part to a directory to an image you wish to encode a message to. 
3) Run the program and follow the one screen instructions.
